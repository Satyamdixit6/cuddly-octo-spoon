# DeepSeek-V3 Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the DeepSeek-V3 architecture, focusing on its key components: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE).

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)
- Implements efficient attention mechanism using latent compression
- Key components:
  - Latent vector compression for keys and values
  - Position-specific keys using RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding)
  - Memory-efficient attention computation

### 2. Mixture of Experts (MoE)
- Implements a sparse mixture of experts architecture
- Features:
  - Dynamic expert routing
  - Load balancing during training
  - Shared and specialized experts
  - Top-k expert selection
