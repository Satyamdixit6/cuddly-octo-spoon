# CUDA Function Showcase

This repository hosts a collection of various CUDA functions, demonstrating different parallel programming techniques and applications on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning resource and a practical demonstration of CUDA C/C++ programming. Each function or set of related functions is typically contained within its own directory or source file, along with explanations of its purpose and implementation details.

## Functions Included (Examples - Please customize this section)

* **Vector Addition:** A fundamental example demonstrating basic memory management and kernel execution.
* **Matrix Multiplication:** Various implementations (e.g., tiled, shared memory) showcasing optimization techniques.
* **Image Processing Kernels:** Examples like grayscale conversion, blur filters, or edge detection.
* **Reduction Algorithms:** Demonstrations of parallel sum, min, max operations.
* **[Add your specific function categories/names here]**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **NVIDIA GPU:** A CUDA-enabled NVIDIA graphics card.
* **NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit:** Download and install the latest version from the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit). Ensure `nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) is in your system's PATH.
* **C++ Compiler:** A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC).

### Compilation

Navigate to the directory of the specific function you are interested in. Compilation instructions are typically provided within that directory's README or directly as comments in the source files.

A common compilation command using `nvcc` might look like:

```bash
nvcc your_cuda_file.cu -o output_executable
